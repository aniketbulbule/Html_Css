<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<!-- 
In CSS, the position property controls how an element is placed in the layout and how it behaves when you use top, right, bottom, or left positioning offsets.

1. static (default)

This is the normal position for every element unless you change it.

The browser just puts it where it should be in the page.

You can’t use top, left, right, or bottom with it.

2. relative

Looks the same as static at first.

But you can move it using top, left, right, or bottom.

The space it originally took is still kept (like it’s a ghost of its old spot).

3. absolute

Sticks to a place inside its nearest parent that is not static.

If no such parent exists, it sticks to the whole page.

It is removed from normal flow, so other elements act like it’s not there.

4. fixed

Always stays in the same spot on your screen even when you scroll.

Often used for menus, headers, or “back to top” buttons.

Like absolute, it’s removed from normal flow.

5. sticky

A mix of relative and fixed.

Acts like relative until you scroll to a certain point.

Then it “sticks” like fixed until you scroll past its container. -->
