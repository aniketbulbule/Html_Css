#Tag

1. An HTML tag is a keyword surrounded by angle brackets, < and >.
2. They are used to mark up the content of a web page, and to specify how the content should be
displayed in a web browser.
3. Every tag in HTML perform specific tasks.

4. Example :

<html> : it means it is starting of Html tag.</html> : Here , '/' means it is ending of Html tag.
5. The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.

#We Have Two Types Of Tags

1. Container Tag (Paired tag)
1. Those tags we have to close , we call them Container tag.
2. Example : < html > </html> , <head></head>, <body> </body>, etc.

2. Non Container tag
1. Non Container tags are knows as void tag , empty tag and singleton tag because they don't have
cloasing tag , so we cannot put content in between tag
2. Those tags we need not to close , we call them non Container tag
3. Example : <br>,<img> , <input> , etc -->

#Elements

1. HTML elements are the basic units of HTML.
2. An HTML element consists of a opening tag, content, and an closing tag, and can also contain
attributes that provide additional information about the element.
Element = opening tag + content + closing tag.
4. For example, the following code creates an HTML element called "p" (which stands for "paragraph"),
with the text "This is a paragraph." as its content:<p> This is a paragraph. </p>In this
example <p> is the start tag, 'This is a paragraph.' is the content, and </p> is the end tag. The "p"
element defines a paragraph of text.

#Types Of Elements

1. Block Level Element
1. These elements will take complete width of the container.
2. Theses elements will always start from a new line.
3. We can set Height and Width for the block level elements.
4. Example: <p> tag, heading tags,<div> tag, etc. -->
<!-- 
2. Inline Level Element
1. These elements will take space required by the content.
2. These elements will not start from a new line.
3. We cannot set Height and Width for the inline level elements.
4. Example: <img> tag, <b> tag,<span> tag, etc. -->
